# Accident_severity_prediction

Group assignment task:
=====================
The purpose of the assignment is to
select a business problem that can be solved with the help of predictive modelling techniques, select a
dataset to study the problem, and perform any pre-processing steps (data transformation, data cleaning,
normalization, subset selection, etc.) necessary before a statistical or a machine learning model can be
constructed.

The following steps aree present:

(1) Introduction: business objective and its context (the practical problem that can be later solved
with a regression or classification model)

(2) Descriptive statistics on the dataset

(3) Exploratory data analysis

(4) Data preprocessing (data cleaning, normalization, scaling, handling missing values, removal of
outliers, etc.)

(5) Construction of predictive features (optional)




Individual assignment task:
==========================
The purpose of the assignment is
to implement and evaluate several alternative predictive models to address the problem selected in the
group assignment.

The following steps are present:

(1) Introduction: business objective

(2) Baseline method

(3) Feature selection (optional)

(4) Hyperparameter tuning

(5) Model evaluation

(6) Conclusion: key findings, possible future improvements
